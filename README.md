# Data-Modeling-with-ETL-by-PostgresSQL

# Description 
In this project, I applid the knowledge on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

# Dataset

## Song dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

## Log dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.
