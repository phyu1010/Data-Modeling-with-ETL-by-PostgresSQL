# Data-Modeling-with-ETL-by-PostgresSQL
Project Description

In this project, I applid the knowledge on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
